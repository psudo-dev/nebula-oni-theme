## Nebula Syntax <!-- omit in toc -->

**Nebula Syntax** was born by chance and not by design. Initially it was just me trying to add purple to a different color palette, but it didn't work and I ended up creating a completely new color palette.

I kept tweaking the colors until I reached a balance and harmony that allowed for more color combinations. I kept trying different combinations until - several pints and comparisons later - I started to see a pattern of what worked and what not so I could create the **Color Schemes**.

## Color Schemes

I wanted the different color schemes to have a different feel from each other instead of a simple color swap. I also wanted to maintain a certain coherence so a color scheme can fall back to their pair, which then fall back to the syntax colors.

There are 4 colors that are shared among all 4 color schemes. Variables are **White**, Punctuations are **Cyan**, Invalid are **Red** and Deprecated are **Brown**.

**Hourglass and Spirograph** share some colors in common, for instance, Strings are **Blue** while Properties are **Magenta** and Numbers are **Pink**. For **Pegasus and Cerberus**, they have **Green** Strings, Properties are **Purple** and numbers are **Yellow**.

The remaining colors of each **Color Scheme** are completely different between them. There were some colors that I wanted to pair together more often, be it because they worked well together but also to try to reproduce the **_Nebula colors_** throughout the code.

When everything made sense and there was nothing left bothering me, then I finally felt like I finished this project - although that happened several times and every time there was something new to change or improve, so maybe this will be endless, hopefully not.

## Syntax Brightness

To be honest, this is not something I will be using but it's another option to have and maybe some of you do prefer it, even more when working at night, I don't know.

The colors are about 10~15% darker - and I say like that because simply making it equally darker doesn't work well for colors.

You can also use darker background colors with it so you get a bit of the contrast back but the overall colors will be darker.

### Normal vs Dimmed

In this first example you have the same **Grey Background**, the first one has the **Normal Syntax Brightness** while the other is **Dimmed**.

In this second example the **Syntax Brightness** settings are the same as the one before but the background now is **Dark Grey**. The contrast changes.

### Different Background

In this next example the second one isn't just using the **Dimmed** option but also with a **Dark Grey Background**. This increases the contrast to similar levels to the **Normal Syntax Brightness** with **Grey Background**, but the overall theme is darker.

### Four Different Contrast Levels

Finally, we have all the contrast level options.

**Darker Background** with **Normal Syntax Brightness** for **high-contrast** settings.

**Normal Background** and **Normal Syntax Brightness** or **Darker Background** with **Dimmed Syntax Brightness** for a middle of the pack contrast level.

And for **low-contrast**, just combine **Dimmed Syntax Brightness** with **Normal Background Color**.

## Comments

Sometimes, depending on the time of the day or the lighting, I find the default **grey for comments** a bit harder to read in a glimpse.

But I wanted to have more options so I tried to provide like an alternative version of the RGB, but at the same time, I didn't want it to match the colors that were already used in the **Nebula Syntax** - which wasn't very easy.

There are 4 colors for comments, the standard **grey**, but also **violet**, **magenta** and **forest**, each of the colors have a lighter and a darker version, for a total of **8 options**.

## Color Scheme - Universal

#### Markdown

**Markdown** has a universal color combination, so it's the same for any **Color Scheme** you choose.

## Color Schemes - by Pair

### JSON

In **JSON** files the **key** and **value** pairs alternate in colors for each level. It follows the **property** and **string** colors of the **Color Schemes**.
